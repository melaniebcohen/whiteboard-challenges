## Problem Domain

Write a function that takes in a numeric array and returns an object literal with two properties:

* the highest value in the array
* the second highest value in the array


Write at least four tests for this function

* your tests should cover basic (expected) functionality
* your tests should consider edge cases for your function (ex: will your function still operate on an array of floating point integers?)
