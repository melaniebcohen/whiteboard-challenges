## Problem Domain
Write a function which accepts `n` and a linked list as it's input. Your function should `return` the nth from the last node in the linked list.

For example:

``` javascript
// given:
const ll = new LinkedList();
findN(ll, 3)

// return:
{
  val: 'value of the 3rd from last node',
  next: { ... }
}
```
